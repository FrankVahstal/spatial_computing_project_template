## Design Goal

In this project the challenge is to design a housing complex incorporating several communal/public facilities for a cooperative live-work-play association. A group of graduate students and young professionals have formed this cooperative to make their own live-work-play space. The housing complex is to accommodate students, young graduates (starters), and assisted living. The complex also provides communal/public facilities, almost as a collective.
