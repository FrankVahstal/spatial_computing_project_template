Welcome to the project repository for the course Computational Design Studio 2020/2021 of [group 4](/about/). This course is part of the minor Spatial Computing in Architectural design at the TU Delft. 

The course has given us an introduction to a participatory generative approach to architectural design. We have learned about mathematical and computational skills in geometry, topology and graph theory and used these skills to make analyses, simulations and optimizations on a building envelope.  
Because the form of the project is systematically derived from functional requirements, we have learned, not to make a building in the usual parametric style, but how to develop computational design workflows.

This project repository is a demonstration of our operational workflow, in which we will show the [planning](/A1_Planning/Process/), the [configuring](/A2_Configuring/Process/), the [massing](/A3_Massing/Process/Sun%20analysis/Sun%20analysis/) and the [forming](/A3_Massing/Process/Sun%20analysis/Sun%20analysis/) of the new building.
